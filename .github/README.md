ABOUT WSL for WINDOWS 11 - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about

WSL stands for Windows Subsystem for Linux, a feature of Windows that
allows users to run a Linux environment directly on their Windows
machine without needing a separate virtual machine or dual-booting.

Here you have more stuff about WSL and other desktops for Linux and Windows 11/10 to build.

How it Works:

WSL2 integrates a lightweight virtual machine to host a full Linux kernel. This approach provides excellent 
compatibility for Linux tools and applications while maintaining high performance for file operations.
Linux distributions are run as isolated containers within the WSL2-managed VM, with their own namespaces
but sharing common Windows resources like the network. 

Installation:
To get started with WSL2, you need to enable the necessary Windows features and then install a Linux
distribution, such as Ubuntu, from the Microsoft Store or by using the wsl --install command in PowerShell.
